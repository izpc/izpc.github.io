# 我的问题

我需要你写一个 prompt，实现如下需求，我的母语是中文，分析我写的英文技术博客，请修改我的技术文章达到雅思8分水平，并且标注出我写的文章的单词和语法操作，并给出英语语句合理的陈述方式，根据文章内容推测我的英语水平，在文章下面给出一些推荐的单词和短语，并评测文章的好坏，主要目的是能够帮助我达到英语母语水平写技术文章，可以在原文章上通过markdown以及颜色合理标记出修改部分

## GPT
好的，这是一个你可以使用的prompt。注意，我会使用Markdown的格式进行注释和修改，因此你需要在支持Markdown的编辑器中查看它。我会使用`~~strikethrough~~`来表示我建议删除的部分，`**bold**`来表示我建议添加的部分，以及`> quote`来提供对修改的解释和评价。

# ChatGPT
Revision:
```
Today, I delved into Kafka knowledge and discovered the "Geek Time" website. I believe I shouldn't limit my learning journey or my future. Therefore, I need to study English and programming technology daily. Furthermore, I should document my learning progress through daily blogging.

This is just the beginning. By integrating ChatGPT into my learning process, I'm confident about the promising future ahead.
```

Revision Explanation:
1. ~~Today I learn about kakfa knowledge, and also know about "geek time" website.~~ **Today, I delved into Kafka knowledge and discovered the "Geek Time" website.**
   > The revised sentence provides a more active and detailed description of your actions. "Delved into" suggests a deeper level of engagement with the material, and "discovered" suggests the novelty of finding the website.

2. ~~I feel I should not limit myself for study and the future.~~ **I believe I shouldn't limit my learning journey or my future.**
   > "Believe" is a stronger term than "feel" in this context, and "learning journey" is a more descriptive and engaging term than "study."

3. ~~So I need study english and programming technology every day and even more I should blog my study everyday.~~ **Therefore, I need to study English and programming technology daily. Furthermore, I should document my learning progress through daily blogging.**
   > The revised sentence provides a clearer structure and flow. "Document my learning progress" is a more precise and formal way to describe the act of blogging about your studies.

4. ~~It's a start for beginning now. I can be super indivial for combining chatgpt, I think my future will come.~~ **This is just the beginning. By integrating ChatGPT into my learning process, I'm confident about the promising future ahead.**
   > The revised sentence has a more positive and confident tone. "Integrating ChatGPT into my learning process" is a clearer way to describe your use of ChatGPT, and "the promising future ahead" is a more positive and optimistic view of the future.

Based on your text, I would estimate that your English level is intermediate. You have a good grasp of basic sentence structure and vocabulary, but there are some areas where your phrasing could be more natural and fluent.

Here are some words and phrases I recommend you use:

- "Delve into": This phrase means to deeply engage or invest time in a topic or subject.
- "Learning journey": This is a more descriptive and engaging term than "study," and it implies a continuous process of growth and discovery.
- "Document my learning progress": This is a more formal and precise way to describe the act of blogging about your studies.

Overall, your blog post shows a clear commitment to learning and self-improvement, which is commendable. The content is straightforward and to the point. However, you could benefit from using more descriptive language and varying your sentence structure to make your writing more engaging. Keep practicing and don't hesitate to use tools like ChatGPT to assist you in your learning journey!
